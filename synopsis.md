# Introduction
- In our daily lives, we deal with several important documents such as ID cards, licenses, insurance papers, certificates, and warranty cards.
- Each of these has an expiry date, and forgetting those dates often causes problems — late renewals, fines, and unnecessary stress.
- ReMindMe is a simple and smart system that helps users store all their important document details in one place and get automatic reminders before those documents expire.
- The system makes it easy for people to stay organized, avoid penalties, and renew things on time without worry.



# Problem Statement
- People commonly forget expiry dates of their personal or official documents because:
    - They store documents physically and don’t check them regularly.
    - They have multiple expiry dates (like license, PAN, insurance, etc.).
	- There is no single system that reminds them automatically.
- Due to this, users face issues like late renewals, penalties, or document invalidation.
- So, there is a need for a simple and automated reminder system to handle expiry dates efficiently.



# Aims and Objectives
The main goal of this project is to help users remember the expiry dates of all important documents.
Objectives:
1.	To store document details (name, type, expiry date, image).
2.	To display upcoming and expired documents clearly.
3.	To send alerts or notifications before expiry.
4.	To allow users to upload and view document images easily.
5.	To reduce delays, penalties, and missed renewals.
6.	To provide a user-friendly, simple interface for managing documents.



# Project Category
This project falls under the category of:
- Web-Based Application (PHP + MySQL)
- It is an information management and reminder system.



# Front-End and Back-End Technologies
- Frontend Technologies
•	HTML5 – For creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
•	CSS3 – For styling, responsive design, and user interface formatting.
•	JavaScript – For client-side validation and interactive UI features.
- Backend Technologies
•	PHP – For server-side logic, form handling, validations, file upload security, and data processing.
•	MySQL – For storing user accounts, documents, expiry dates, and system data.


# Minimum System Requirements
- For Users (Client Side)
    •	Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    •	Basic internet connection (if hosted online).
    •	Minimum 1 GB RAM device (mobile or PC can run it).
- For Developers (System Side)
    •	Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS
    •	RAM: Minimum 4 GB
    •	Software Required:
        o	VS Code (or any code editor)
        o	XAMPP 
        o	phpMyAdmin (for database)




# Number of Modules and Description
1. User Module
    o	Handles user registration, login, password security, session management, and profile updates.
2. Dashboard Module
    o	Displays the overall summary such as total documents, upcoming expiry alerts, expired documents, and quick navigation buttons.
3. Document Management Module
    o	Core module where users can add, view, edit, and delete documents.
    o   Includes validation, file uploads, expiry date tracking, and secure file handling.
4. Settings Module
    o	Contains profile settings, password change option, app information (About RemindMe) and logout.
5. Notification Module
    o	Highlights documents that are near or past expiry.
    o   Acts as a reminder system inside the dashboard to warn users in advance.



# Limitations	
-	The system depends on the accuracy of dates entered by users (manual input).
-	Email or notification reminders require an active internet connection.
-	OCR-based auto date reading may not always be 100% accurate (optional feature).
-	Currently designed for individual use, not for large-scale organizations.



# Conclusion
- ReMindMe is a useful and practical project that solves a real-life problem.
- It helps people stay organized and never forget an expiry date again.
- The system is easy to use, reliable, and efficient — combining the simplicity of a reminder app with the smartness of a document manager. 
- This project demonstrates how small digital tools can make daily life more convenient and efficient, especially   when built with common technologies like Java, PHP, and MySQL.
